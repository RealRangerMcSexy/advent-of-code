# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles released from December 1st to December 25th.

## 🌟 Structure

```

## 🚀 Solutions

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Solution |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](2024/day-1) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-1/solution.py) |
| [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](2024/day-2) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-2/solution.py) |
| [Day 3: Mull It Over](2024/day-3) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-3/solution.py) |
| [Day 4: Ceres Search](2024/day-4) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-4/solution.py) |
| [Day 5: Print Queue](2024/day-5) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-5/solution.py) |
| [Day 6: Guard Gallivant](2024/day-6) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Python](2024/day-6/solution.py) |

## 🛠️ Running Solutions

1. Each day's solution is in its own directory
2. Input files are stored as `input.txt` in the respective day's directory
3. Problem descriptions are in `question.md` files
4. To run a solution:
   ```bash
   cd 2024/day-1
   python solution.py
   ```

## 📝 Notes

- Solutions aim to be clear and readable rather than code-golfed
- Each day's directory includes:
  - Solution code (`solution.py`)
  - Input data (`input.txt`)
  - Problem description (`question.md`)
  - Part 2 description (`question-2.md`) when applicable

## ⭐ Progress Tracking

- ⭐ = First part completed
- ⭐⭐ = Both parts completed
- Blank = Not started/In progress
